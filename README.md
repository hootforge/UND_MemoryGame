# Memory Game Project

##  This is my game.

* The game will start when you first load index.html, with a timer counting how long you take.

* Click the Refresh button to start a new game.

* Once you match all of the cards, it will give you a final score and option to restart.

* The game requires its accompanying .js and .css files, the googlefont coda family, and bootstrap font-awesome.
